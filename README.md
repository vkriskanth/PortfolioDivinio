# Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive data processing and analytics platform built using Python. It includes various components for data ingestion, engineering, analysis, and visualization, as well as RESTful APIs for programmatic access and Streamlit apps for interactive user interfaces.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

- **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis, prototyping, and supporting workflows.
- **`streamlit_apps/`**: Houses Streamlit applications for interactive data visualization and analysis.
- **`rest_api/`**: Implements RESTful APIs to expose functionality for integration with external systems.
- **`data_ingestion/`**: Includes scripts for collecting, processing, and loading data from various sources.
- **`data_engineering/`**: Contains scripts and modules for transforming raw data into structured formats for analysis.
- **`data/`**: Stores sample datasets used across the project.
- **`config/`**: Configuration files for various components.
- **`logs/`**: Log files generated during data processing and execution.
