# Data Engineering

This folder contains scripts and modules for data engineering tasks, designed to transform raw data into a structured and usable format. These scripts support the project's data pipelines and ensure data quality, consistency, and readiness for analysis.

## Overview

The data engineering scripts in this folder aim to:
- Perform data transformation and cleaning.
- Build and manage data pipelines.
- Ensure data quality and consistency.
- Prepare data for downstream analytics or machine learning workflows.

## Structure

The folder is organized as follows:
- **`scripts/`**: Contains standalone data engineering scripts.
- **`modules/`**: Reusable Python modules for data engineering tasks.
- **`config/`**: Configuration files for pipeline settings.
- **`logs/`**: Log files generated during data engineering processes.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the data engineering folder.

## Prerequisites

To use the data engineering scripts, ensure you have:
1. Python 3.8 or later installed.
2. Required dependencies installed (see `requirements.txt`).

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the `scripts/` folder.
2. Run the desired data engineering script:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```
3. Monitor logs in the `logs/` folder for details about the process.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute by:
- Adding new data engineering scripts or modules.
