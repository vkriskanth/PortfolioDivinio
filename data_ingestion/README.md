# Data Ingestion

This folder contains scripts and modules for data ingestion, designed to collect, process, and load data from various sources into the project. These scripts ensure that data is prepared and ready for analysis or further processing.

## Overview

The data ingestion scripts in this folder aim to:
- Extract data from multiple sources (e.g., databases, APIs, files).
- Transform and clean the data as needed.
- Load the data into the appropriate storage or processing pipeline.

## Structure

The folder is organized as follows:
- **`scripts/`**: Contains standalone data ingestion scripts.
- **`config/`**: Configuration files for data source settings.
- **`logs/`**: Log files generated during data ingestion processes.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the data ingestion folder.

## Prerequisites

To use the data ingestion scripts, ensure you have:
1. Python 3.8 or later installed.
2. Required dependencies installed (see `requirements.txt`).

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the `scripts/` folder.
2. Run the desired data ingestion script:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```
3. Monitor logs in the `logs/` folder for details about the ingestion process.

Feel free to contribute by:
- Adding new data ingestion scripts.
