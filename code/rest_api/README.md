# REST API

This folder contains the implementation of RESTful APIs designed to expose functionality for data processing, analytics, or integration with external systems. These APIs provide a standardized way to interact with the project's features programmatically.

## Overview

The REST APIs in this folder aim to:
- Expose functionality from KNIME workflows, Python scripts, or Streamlit apps.
- Enable integration with external applications or services.
- Provide a scalable and accessible interface for data and analytics.

## Structure

The folder is organized as follows:
- **`endpoints/`**: Contains individual API endpoint implementations.
- **`config/`**: Configuration files for API settings.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the REST API folder.

## Prerequisites

To use the REST APIs, ensure you have:
1. Python 3.8 or later installed.
2. Required dependencies installed (see `requirements.txt`).

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the API server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Access the API endpoints using tools like `curl`, Postman, or by integrating them into your application.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute by:
- Adding new API endpoints.
- Improving existing implementations.
- Updating documentation.
