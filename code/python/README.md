# Python Code

This folder contains Python scripts and modules designed to support the KNIME dashboards and workflows. These scripts may include data preprocessing, custom analytics, or utility functions to enhance the functionality of the dashboards.

## Overview

The Python code in this folder aims to:
- Provide additional data processing capabilities.
- Implement custom analytics or machine learning models.
- Support integration with KNIME workflows.

## Structure

The folder is organized as follows:
- **`scripts/`**: Contains standalone Python scripts.
- **`modules/`**: Reusable Python modules for specific tasks.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory analysis or prototyping.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the Python folder.

## Prerequisites

To use the Python code, ensure you have:
1. Python 3.8 or later installed.
2. Required dependencies installed (see `requirements.txt`).

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- Run scripts directly from the `scripts/` folder.
- Import modules from the `modules/` folder into your Python projects.
- Use Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder for interactive analysis.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute by:
- Adding new scripts or modules.
- Improving existing code.
- Updating documentation.
