# Jupyter Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks designed for exploratory data analysis, prototyping, and supporting the KNIME workflows and dashboards. These notebooks provide an interactive environment for data manipulation, visualization, and model development.

## Overview

The Jupyter Notebooks in this folder aim to:
- Facilitate exploratory data analysis.
- Prototype machine learning models and analytics.
- Complement the KNIME workflows with additional insights.

## Structure

The folder is organized as follows:
- **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for various tasks.
- **`data/`**: Sample datasets used in the notebooks.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the notebooks folder.

## Prerequisites

To use the notebooks, ensure you have:
1. Python 3.8 or later installed.
